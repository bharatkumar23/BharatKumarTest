PART-A (Theory)

1). 
Front-end:
The front-end, refers to the part of the website that users interact with directly. It involves the presentation and user interface components. The main technologies used in the front-end are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is used to structure the content of the website, defining the elements and their hierarchy. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is responsible for styling the HTML elements, controlling their appearance, layout, and visual presentation. JavaScript is used to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to the website, such as form validation, animations, and handling user events.
When a user accesses a website, their web browser retrieves the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files from the server and renders them to display the website's content and visual design. Users can interact with the front-end components, fill out forms, click buttons, and navigate through the website's pages.

Back-end:
The back-end, also known as the server-side, handles the behind-the-scenes functionality of a website. It involves processing and storing data, handling business logic, and generating dynamic content. The back-end is responsible for interacting with databases, performing calculations, and serving requested data to the front-end.The back-end is implemented using various programming languages and frameworks, such as PHP, Python, Ruby, Java, or Node.js. It communicates with the front-end through APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) or other mechanisms.
The back-end typically consists of a web server that receives requests from the front-end, processes those requests, performs necessary operations (such as querying databases or performing calculations), and generates responses. The responses are then sent back to the front-end, which can update the user interface accordingly.
The back-end also deals with user authentication, security, and other server-side operations. It may involve components like databases, server software, application logic, and external services or APIs.


2).
Structural Tags:
  Structural tags define the overall structure and layout of the web page.
  example: <html>, <head>, <title>, <body>
Heading Tags: 
  Heading tags define various levels of headings on a page, from the main heading (h1) to subheadings (h2, h3, ....)
  example: <h1>Main Heading</h1>, <h2>Subheading</h2>
Paragraph Tags:
  Paragraph tags define paragraphs of text.
  example: <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
Link Tags:
  Link tags define hyperlinks to other web pages or resources.
  example: <a #href="https://www.google.com">google</a>
Image Tags:
  Image tags define and display images on a web page.
  example: <img #src="image.jpg" alt="image">
Form Tags:
  Form tags define interactive forms for user input, such as text fields, checkboxes, and buttons.
  example: 
   <form>
      label for="name">Name:</label>
      input type="text" id="name">
      button type="submit">Submit</button>
   </form>
Table Tags:
  Table tags define tables to display tabular data.
  example: 
    "<table>
      <tr>
         <th>Header 1</th>
         <th>Header 2</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td>Data 1</td>
         <td>Data 2</td>
      </tr>
    </table>"
List Tags:
  List tags define ordered (numbered) and unordered (bullet) lists.
  example: 
"<ul>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
</ul>
<ol>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
</ol>"


3).
The Virtual DOM (VDOM) is a concept used in frameworks like React.js to optimize the process of updating user interfaces. It works by creating a virtual representation of the actual DOM, which is a tree-like structure representing the elements in an HTML document. 
When a component's state changes, a new Virtual DOM tree is created. The framework then compares this new tree with the previous one to identify the differences, a process known as diffing. Only the necessary changes are determined and applied to the actual DOM, minimizing performance impact.
The framework generates a patch that represents the required changes to be made to the actual DOM. This patch is then applied, updating the necessary elements and properties. This approach reduces the number of direct DOM manipulations, leading to faster and more efficient updates.
The Virtual DOM ensures that the UI stays in sync with the component's state, resulting in a smoother user experience. It abstracts the complexities of DOM manipulation and allows developers to write declarative code, leaving the optimization to the framework.
Overall, the Virtual DOM provides an abstraction layer that allows developers to write declarative code while the framework handles the efficient rendering of the user interface. It improves rendering efficiency, reduces performance overhead, and results in a smoother user experience in web applications.

MySQL:
1. Data Model: MySQL follows a structured, tabular data model based on predefined schemas and relationships.
2. Query Language: MySQL uses SQL (Structured Query Language) as the standard language for managing and querying relational databases.
3. ACID Compliance: MySQL emphasizes ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) compliance, ensuring data integrity and transactional consistency.
4. Data Relationships: MySQL is well-suited for handling complex data relationships using joins and foreign keys, allowing for efficient data retrieval across multiple tables.
5. Use Cases: MySQL is commonly used for applications that require structured data, strict consistency, and complex queries, such as e-commerce platforms, banking systems, and content management systems.

NoSQL:
1. Data Model: NoSQL databases have a flexible or schema-less data model, allowing for dynamic and unstructured data storage.
2. Query Language: NoSQL databases use various query languages or APIs specific to their data model, such as MongoDB's query language or Cassandra Query Language (CQL).
3. Scalability: NoSQL databases excel at horizontal scalability, distributing data across multiple servers for improved performance and handling large-scale data.
4. Data Relationships: NoSQL databases often sacrifice strict data relationships in favor of high performance and scalability. They typically store related data together within a single document or distribute data across multiple nodes.
5. Use Cases: NoSQL databases are commonly used for handling large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data, real-time data processing, and scenarios where scalability and flexibility are crucial, such as social media analytics, IoT applications, and recommendation engines.

MySQL is a popular open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) known for its reliability, scalability, and ease of use. It follows the relational data model, storing data in tables with predefined schemas. MySQL uses SQL (Structured Query Language) as its query language, making it compatible with various programming languages and frameworks. It offers features such as transactions, indexes, and stored procedures, ensuring data integrity and performance optimization. MySQL is widely used in web development, e-commerce, content management systems, and many other applications where structured data management is essential. It has a large and active community, providing support, resources, and frequent updates. Additionally, MySQL offers different editions, including the open-source Community Edition and commercial Enterprise Edition, catering to various requirements and budgets. MySQL offers robust security features, including user authentication, encryption, and access control. It supports SSL/TLS connections for secure data transmission and has mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access and SQL injection attacks.MySQL integrates well with various programming languages, frameworks, and tools. It has connectors and APIs for languages such as PHP, Python, Java, and more, enabling seamless interaction and data manipulation from different application environments.
